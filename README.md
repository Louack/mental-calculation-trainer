# Mental Calculation Trainer

This small and simple app asks a series of mathemetical operations to the user, 
who has to answer without the help of any tool.

For me, the hidden goal of this app was to get a better understanding of SOLID 
principles, MVC architecture and design patterns.

## Execution

Clone this repository on your local machine, launch the app by executing the
`main.py` file and select the interface you want to interact with 
(console or tkinter).
